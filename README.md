# tic-tac-toe
A python program to play tic tac toe with the computer.
A few things to note about the program:
1) The first move belongs to the user ('O').
2) User inputs their move by entering the number of the square they choose âˆ’ the number must be valid, i.e., it must be an integer, it must be greater than 0 and less than 10, and it cannot point to a field which is already occupied.
3) The computer's move ('X') is implemented by generating a random integer (1-9).
